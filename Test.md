# Sim Finder Panel Styles

**Change the visual style of your sim's panel by writing some simple style indicators in your sim's bio.**
---
To begin the style indicator, type "sifi:" followed by one of these codes:

- bp - pink background
- bsg - seagreen background
- bdg - dark grey background
- br - red background
- bw - white background

You may only choose one style at a time, any additional ones will be ignored.

To end the style indicator, type one last ":" at the end of the sequence.
